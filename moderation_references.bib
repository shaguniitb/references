		  reviewed. Underregulation occurs because of deficient
		  standards, inadequate monitoring, or inadequate strength.
		  Misregulation occurs because of false assumptions or
		  misdirected efforts, especially an unwarranted emphasis on
		  emotion. The evidence supports a strength (limited
		  resource) model of self-regulation and suggests that people
		  often acquiesce in losing control. Loss of control of
		  attention, failure of transcendence, and various
		  lapse-activated causes all contribute to regulatory
		  failure.},

		  mechanisms for personalization, ranking, and content
		  filtering. However, when users evaluate content contributed
		  by fellow users (e.g., by liking a post or voting on a
		  comment), these evaluations create complex social feedback
		  effects. This paper investigates how ratings on a piece of
		  content affect its author's future behavior. By studying
		  four large comment-based news communities, we find that
		  negative feedback leads to significant behavioral changes
		  that are detrimental to the community. Not only do authors
		  of negatively-evaluated content contribute more, but also
		  their future posts are of lower quality, and are perceived
		  by the community as such. Moreover, these authors are more
		  likely to subsequently evaluate their fellow users
		  negatively, percolating these effects through the
		  community. In contrast, positive feedback does not carry
		  similar effects, and neither encourages rewarded authors to
		  write more, nor improves the quality of their posts.
		  Interestingly, the authors that receive no feedback are
		  most likely to leave a community. Furthermore, a structural
		  analysis of the voter network reveals that evaluations
		  polarize the community the most when positive and negative
		  votes are equally split.},

		  about user experience design, refer to points of difficulty

		  often argue that these frictions should be removed from
		  interaction flows in order to reduce the risk of user
		  frustration and disengagement. In this paper we argue that,
		  in many scenarios, designing friction into interactions
		  through the introduction of microboundaries, can, in fact,
		  have positive effects. Design frictions can disrupt "
		  mindless " automatic interactions, prompting moments of
		  reflection and more " mindful " interaction. The potential
		  advantages of intentionally introduced frictions are
		  numerous: from reducing the likelihood of errors in
		  data-entry tasks, to supporting health-behaviour change.},

  abstract	= {Cultural±historical activity theory is a new framework
		  aimed at transcending the dichotomies of micro- and macro-,
		  mental and material, observation and intervention in
		  analysis and redesign of work. The approach distinguishes
		  between short-lived goal-directed actions and durable,
		  object-oriented activity systems. A historically evolving
		  collective activity system, seen in its network relations
		  to other activity systems, is taken as the prime unit of
		  analysis against which scripted strings of goal-directed
		  actions and automatic operations are interpreted. Activity
		  systems are driven by communal motives that are often di?
		  cult to articulate for individual participants. Activity
		  systems are in constant movement and internally
		  contradictory. Their systemic contradictions, mani- fested
		  in disturbances and mundane innovations, o? er
		  possibilities for expansive developmental transformations.
		  Such transformations proceed through stepwise cycles of
		  expansive learning which begin with actions of questioning
		  the existing standard practice, then proceed to actions of
		  analyzing its contradictions and modelling a vision for its
		  zone of proximal development, then to actions of examining
		  and implementing the new model in practice. New forms of
		  work organization increasingly require negotiated
		  `knotworking' across boundaries. Correspondingly, expansive
		  learning increasingly involves horizontal widening of
		  collective expertise by means of debating, negotiating and
		  hybridizing di? erent perspectives and conceptualizations.

		  technical solutions to difficult platform governance

		  hash-matching and predictive machine learning tools –
		  what we define here as algorithmic moderation systems –
		  are increasingly being deployed to conduct content

		  growing public expectations for increased platform

  abstract	= {The impressive success of peer production -- a large-scale
		  collaborative model of production primarily based on
		  voluntary contributions -- is difficult to explain by
		  relying solely on standard assumptions about individual
		  preferences. This paper studies the prosocial foundations
		  of cooperation in Wikipedia, a peer production economy in
		  which monetary incentives play no role in shaping
		  individual behavior. We design an online experiment coupled
		  with observational data to elicit social motives within a
		  representative sample of 850 Wikipedia contributors, and
		  use those measures to predict subjects' field contributions
		  to the Wikipedia project. We thus provide the first
		  comprehensive field test of existing economic theories of
		  prosocial motives for contributing to real-world public
		  goods. We find that regular editors' field contributions to
		  Wikipedia are strongly related to their level of
		  reciprocity in a conditional Public Goods game and in a
		  Trust game and to their revealed preference for social
		  image within the Wikipedia community, but not to their
		  level of altruism either in a standard or in a directed
		  Dictator game. The extent of participation within the group
		  of Wikipedia administrators -- who self-selected into
		  performing a policing role within the Wikipedia community
		  -- is positively related to their revealed preference for
		  social image but, unlike regular contributors, strongly
		  negatively related to their level of reciprocity. Using our
		  measure of trust in strangers from the Trust game, we show
		  that while trust is unrelated to contribution levels among
		  regular editors, less trusting Wikipedia administrators are
		  significantly more active and more likely to exercise their
		  policing rights.},

		  online conversation? Analysis of the site Slashdot.org
		  suggests that the answer is a qualified yes, but that
		  important challenges remain for designers of such systems.
		  Thousands of users act as moderators. Final scores for
		  comments are reasonably dispersed and the community
		  generally agrees that moderations are fair. On the other
		  hand, much of a conversation can pass before the best and
		  worst comments are identified. Of those moderations that
		  were judged unfair, only about half were subsequently
		  counterbalanced by a moderation in the other direction. And
		  comments with low scores, not at top-level, or posted late
		  in a conversation were more likely to be overlooked by
		  moderators.},

		  phenomenon with consequential implications, espe-cially for
		  adolescents, who tend to engage in high-risk behavior
		  online. Through the use of Protection Motivation Theory
		  (PMT), we examine the predictors motivating the intention
		  of youths to adopt protection behavior against online
		  harassment. A survey was conducted with 537 youths from a
		  stratified sample in Singapore. Regression analyses showed
		  that perceived severity of online harassment, response
		  efficacy and self efficacy of online protective behavior
		  were significant predictors of behavioral intention with
		  varying weights. The sole exception was perceived
		  susceptibility to online harassment, which did not
		  significantly predict behavioral intention. Gender and age
		  were also found to moderate adolescents' uptake of
		  protective behavior. The results suggest that public
		  service programs targeted at educating youths should aim to
		  increase coping appraisals and emphasize the severity of
		  online harassment. Targeted educational programs could
		  include those aimed at specific age or gender groups.},

@Article{	  Mittos2019,
  abstract	= {Progress in genomics has enabled the emergence of a
		  booming market for "direct-to-consumer" genetic testing.
		  Nowadays, companies like 23andMe and AncestryDNA provide
		  affordable health, genealogy, and ancestry reports, and
		  have already tested tens of millions of customers. At the
		  same time, alt- and far-right groups have also taken an
		  interest in genetic testing, using them to attack
		  minorities and prove their genetic "purity." In this paper,
		  we present a measurement study shedding light on how
		  genetic testing is being discussed on Web communities in
		  Reddit and 4chan. We collect 1.3M comments posted over 27
		  months on the two platforms, using a set of 280 keywords
		  related to genetic testing. We then use NLP and computer
		  vision tools to identify trends, themes, and topics of
		  discussion. Our analysis shows that genetic testing
		  attracts a lot of attention on Reddit and 4chan, with
		  discussions often including highly toxic language expressed
		  through hateful, racist, and misogynistic comments. In
		  particular, on 4chan's politically incorrect board (/pol/),
		  content from genetic testing conversations involves several
		  alt-right personalities and openly antisemitic rhetoric,
		  often conveyed through memes. Finally, we find that

		  human knowledge today, contributed mostly by a few hundred

		  inevitably, differences of opinion arise among editors of
		  the same article. Especially for polemical topics such as
		  religion and politics, difference of opinions among editors
		  may lead to intense "edit wars" in which editors compete to
		  have their opinions and points of view accepted. While such
		  disputes can compromise the reliability of the article (or
		  at least portions of it), they are recorded in the edit
		  history of the articles. We posit that exposing such
		  disputes to the reader, and pointing to the portions of the
		  text where they manifest most prominently can be beneficial
		  in helping concerned readers in understanding such topics.
		  In this paper, we discuss our initial efforts towards the
		  problem of automatic evaluation of extracting controversial

  abstract	= {Online communities about similar topics may maintain very
		  different norms of interaction. Past research identifies
		  many processes that contribute to maintaining stable norms,
		  including self-selection, pre-entry learning, post-entry
		  learning, and retention. We analyzed political subreddits
		  that had distinctive, stable levels of toxic comments on
		  Reddit, in order to identify the relative contribution of
		  these four processes. Surprisingly, we find that the
		  largest source of norm stability is pre-entry learning.
		  That is, newcomers' first comments in these distinctive
		  subreddits differ from those same people's prior behavior
		  in other subreddits. Through this adjustment, they nearly
		  match the toxicity level of the subreddit they are joining.
		  We also show that behavior adjustments are
		  community-specific and not broadly transformative. That is,
		  people continue to post toxic comments at their previous
		  rates in other political subreddits. Thus, we conclude that
		  in political subreddits, compatible newcomers are neither
		  born nor made– they make local adjustments on their
		  own.},

		  but by civility, and not by its priority or superiority to
		  print and broadcast media but by its necessary dependence

		  associated with young adult women's online harassment
		  experiences through a multi-factor measure accounting for
		  the frequency and severity of negative events. Findings
		  from a survey of 659 undergraduate and graduate students
		  highlight the relationship between harassment, well-being,
		  and engagement in strategies to manage one's online
		  identity. We further identify differences in harassment
		  experiences across three popular social media platforms:
		  Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We conclude by discussing
		  this study's contribution to feminist theory and describing
		  five potential design interventions derived from our data
		  that may minimize these negative experiences, mitigate the
		  psychological harm they cause, and provide women with more
		  proactive ways to regain agency when using communication

  abstract	= {The freedom of expression is perhaps not the most basic
		  freedom-freedom of movement being the most basic freedom
		  and of utmost importance as it determines and precedes all
		  others-but it is certainly the foremost modem freedom. To
		  freely speak one's mind, represent one's viewpoint, defend
		  one's opinions, communicate one's ideas-including "those
		  that shock, offend, or disturb"l-without fear for life,
		  liberty, or possessions, but with peace of mind and a firm
		  certainty of freedom from government harassment, is a
		  freedom that humanity has only recently enjoyed. Protection
		  for this freedom scarcely arose before the revolutions of
		  the eighteenth century. Freedom of expression was born from
		  the upheavals caused by the sixteenth-century reformation.
		  The birth of this right is credited to the
		  Protestants-those who, as their name indicates, dared to
		  protest and reclaimed the right to dissidence. Inseparable
		  from the freedoms of thought and religion, the right to
		  expression is the landmark freedom of modernity. It goes
		  hand-in-hand with the affirmation of self, the rise of the
		  individual in the social domain, and the liberation of an
		  acting and thinking self freed from the paternalism of
		  society. The right to expression is the preeminent Western
		  freedom. Though the freedom of expression is closely
		  related to religious freedom, its legal recognition
		  occurred much later. In England, legal recognition of free
		  expression was first realized in the 1689 Bill of Rights,
		  but it only provided for free speech within the confines of
		  Parliament. 2 In the eighteenth century, Anglo-Saxon
		  empiricism gave it new life while the spirit of the
		  Enlightenment gave it extraordinary growth by fighting
		  against blasphemy laws and defending freedom of the press.
		  The French Revolutionaries established that "[t]he free
		  communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the most
		  precious of the rights of man," and that "[e]very citizen
